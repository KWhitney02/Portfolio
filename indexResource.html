				<p>I am looking any position that involves coding or designing a game in a RPG genre; however, if story development, character design, or level design are open I would prefer those openings. I have a massive creative mindset that I can create stories from the top of my head and will develop more and more over time. Also, I can keep stories and characters for long periods of time. The only downside is I am unable to imagine character facials until I draw them.</p>
				
				<p>I’m not looking for any specific programming languages as I have experienced multiple languages. To go in detail, what languages I learned are Python, C++, HTML5, Android, Linux, and JavaScript. The language I am the most proficient in is JavaScript because it was the easiest to comprehend while learning and improving it with barely any problems. I have a year of experience with almost all my programming languages except for Python as I put in a half a year more than the other languages.</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, I prefer working alone as I become very anxious around people and become worse when I’m in close distance between people. I can work in a team, but have difficulties with eye contact and creating and maintaining relationships with co-workers. Less worker to work with the more confidence in my work will be. The reason is that working with teams makes me become self conscious about my effort in the work and may lead to extending my work to other co-workers' work in the projects.This will to conflict with my co-workers as I might be overstepping into their part of the work.</p>
